## Ditch Cloudflare

Cloudflare doesn't have good content moderation policies and refuses to remove a hate speech site.
So I must move my hosting and money from them.

Context:

https://www.dropkiwifarms.net/

> #DropKiwifarms works to end the relationship between far-right hate forum Kiwi Farms and the digital service providers that keep Kiwi Farms active online. We 
> started this campaign after members on the website published private information on Clara Sorrenti, including sexually explicit photos and videos, phone 
> numbers, addresses, her deadname and the private information of her friends and family. Publishing that information led to threats on her life, both implicit 
> and explicit, as well as attempts to end her life through false reports to the police about imminent violence -- a practice that has ended the lives of other
> people.

## Plan

1. copy dns to a file from cloudflare
2. add zone to google cloud with existing dns entries
3. move the name servers to be google via metaname

at this point the blog is migrated ðŸ˜„

for the remaining things I used cloudflare for (reverse proxy and automated TLS)

4. start a VPS with decent bandwidth
5. connect VPS to tailscale network
6. configure caddy as a reverse proxy with tls certs
7. replicate the app hostname configurations with caddy + tailscale
