* So you want to host a website?

I'm hosting this blog using AWS and s3 through cloudflare it's a mix of technology that is useful for me to pick up right now because it's matured and I like (boring technology)[http://boringtechnology.club/].

However the biggest issue I faced was inconsistient documentation relating to permissions so I'm going to note down what I've done to help anyone else wanting to do the same thing.
