Hi There,

I'm working on a static site generator to note down all the stuff I'm learning in Web development.
Hopefully it's useful enough as a record for other people because everything seems to be moving into private siloes run by a handful of companies and then isn't able to be searched through for future users.
I wanted to use tumblr for posting my code musings but then it got bought by yahoo and all the drama afterwards shook my confidence.
I think i've used blogger 10 years ago but that wasn't interesting in a technical sense so it felt like busywork.

Let's see how this goes eh?
